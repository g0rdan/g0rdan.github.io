I have over 5 years of experience in mobile development, particularly in the world of Xamarin. However, I’m not bounded by Xamarin; I can write clear and maintainable code in many languages for different platforms. Over the past year I’ve tried to focus more on Flutter as my primary dev tool. Now, I’m looking for a role where I can be challenged, learn new skills, and contribute to an interesting and valuable project.

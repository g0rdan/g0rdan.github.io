I’m a big C# fan! My area of choice is the .NET universe, especially now that Microsoft has turned to the open source community. Speaking of OSS, I’m also a team member in MvvmCross. My interests include all aspects of mobile development and more. I prefer C# / .NET but if needed, I can easily switch to another language / technology, depending on the task.

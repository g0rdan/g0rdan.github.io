Probably you saw my previuos [post](http://g0rdan.com/2017-08-18/My-favorite-vs4mac-plugins/) about plugins for vs4mac. If you didn't see follow by link, you'll like it.

I mentonied on post about **Macaque Tips** plugin. I really like it and I want to tell about the plugin more.

Here we'll consider useful tips from the plugin.

1. As I wrote in the plugin post, if you'll press `Command + .` the focus of IDE jumps to the search input. You can write name of file or class and jump directly to the file or class. But very few people know that if you'll write, for example, `MainActivity:25` into search field, you'll jump straight in 25 line on MainActivity file.

2. Visual Studio for Mac has greate feature to help you mark some pice of code which helps you don't forget this place. It can be some code for rewriting, some bug in code, etc. For example, If you found some bug and you don't have enough time to fix this, you can write `FIXME` right into your code in comment sections as on picture below. After that you can find all of your warnings in *Tasks* area. Also you can add `TODO`, `HACK` and `UNDONE`. To setup this environment you have to go to `Preferences -> Environment -> Tasks`.

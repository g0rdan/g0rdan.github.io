First of all, I need explain why we have to review this. Most of all frameworks can work with platforms without using Xamarin.Forms and they do it great! But now, Xamarin inc. do a lot of promotion to use Xamarin.Forms. They bet on this. Which is good. I like the fact that we can use a shared UI. I not so like the way to do this in Xamarin.Forms, but they, as I can see, are slowly turning out from the way, when I need use Xamarin.Forms project to all of my application, to a way, when I can pick only a few shared UI elements (views, controlls) and use them only a few screens.

Second of all, we need a common platform to see how frameworks are working and it's Xamarin.Forms projects. You can say "Xamarin.Forms already has MVVM pattern implementation inside" and you will be right. But many of frameworks have more things that only MVVM and it should to help you build a great apps.

I suggest to make a simple projects for each of frameworks. It's app for iOS and Android. The app will be showing two screens. The first will contain a list of cat names and second will has a picture of each cats.

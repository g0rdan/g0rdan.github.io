Good morning/day/evening, I'm Denis and I'll write some posts about dev, mobile, IT here.
The main purpose of this blog is making my English level more higher. I'm going to find job in states and I have to impove my language skills. By the way, if you are looking at some programmer and think I can fit for you, let me know.
I preffer write English articles, but sometimes I'll make translate from En to Ru.
